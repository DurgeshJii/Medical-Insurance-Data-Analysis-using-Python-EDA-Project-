# Medical-Insurance-Data-Analysis-using-Python-EDA-Project-
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an insurance dataset to uncover insights related to medical insurance charges and the factors affecting them. The analysis demonstrates the complete data analytics workflow, including data cleaning, feature understanding, visualization, and insight generation using Python.
The dataset contains demographic and lifestyle attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region, along with corresponding insurance charges.

🔹 Objectives

Understand the structure and quality of the dataset

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Analyze relationships between variables and insurance charges

Identify key factors influencing insurance costs

Visualize insights using statistical plots

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – analysis environment

🔹 Key Analysis Performed

Checked missing values and data types

Descriptive statistics of numerical features

Impact of smoking, BMI, age, and region on insurance charges

Comparison of insurance costs across gender and number of children

Distribution analysis and correlation study

🔹 Key Insights

Smoking status has a significant impact on insurance charges

Higher BMI and age generally lead to increased insurance costs

Regional differences slightly affect insurance pricing

Non-smokers show more consistent and lower charge distributions
